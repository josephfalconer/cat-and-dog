- Find any document.getElementById and replace with React equivalent

- Tidy up actions so that not making one call after another: just pass one payload. Eg lines 41-3 of App

- Maybe eliminate passed functions like endTheGame and find a way to do this through store?

- Consider using React.PureComponent to increase performance

- Just use one basic store update function in actions/index.js

- Consider replacing for (var of array) loops with forEach - then Symbol polyfill isn't needed?

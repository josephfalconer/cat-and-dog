- Find any document.getElementById and replace with React equivalent

- Refactor out this.setState in Player.js...? Find a cleaner way to set/reference one store data set for positions/face etc of players.

- Tidy up classnames/CSS - still using 'garden-' classnames.

- Consider refactoring out App.js's 
state = {
        isShowingHints: false,
        isReadyShutters: false,
    }
and state setting functions - use store for this?

- upgrade react/react dom etc and use createRef?

- create sprites for cat/dog

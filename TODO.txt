- Find any document.getElementById and replace with React equivalent

- Maybe eliminate passed functions like endTheGame and find a way to do this through store?

- Consider using React.PureComponent to increase performance

- Consider replacing for (var of array) loops with forEach - then Symbol polyfill isn't needed?

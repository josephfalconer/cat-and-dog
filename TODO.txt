- Find any document.getElementById and replace with React equivalent

- Food items are a simpleComponent and fade themselves and pop up

- Spaces without occupant should be null not false

- Tidy up actions so that not making one call after another: just pass one payload. Eg lines 41-3 of App

- Maybe eliminate passed functions like endTheGame and find a way to do this through store?

- Investigate how rendering slows performance with food appearing:
	- Create a new component FoodLayer
	- Food appearing/disappearing doesn't cause Board re-renders

- Consider using React.SimpleComponent to increase performance

- Just use one basic store update function in actions/index.js

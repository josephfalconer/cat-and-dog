- Refactor out this.setState in Player.js...? Find a cleaner way to set/reference one store data set for positions/face etc of players.

- Tidy up classnames/CSS - still using 'garden-' classnames.

- Consider moving local state into store wherever used.

- upgrade react/react dom etc and use createRef?

- create sprites for cat/dog
